# ETSR-Framework: Ensemble Teacher-Student Refinement for Auto-Labeling

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
ETSR-Framework is an automated labeling system designed for object detection tasks. The framework uses a semi-supervised learning approach, leveraging multiple YOLO models trained on distinct portions of labeled data. These models collaborate through a majority voting mechanism to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data.  

The framework follows an **iterative auto-labeling** process, progressively refining pseudo-labels until the entire dataset is labeled. The final dataset is used to train a YOLO model for evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Iterative Auto-Labeling:** Uses multiple YOLO models to generate and refine pseudo-labels.
- **Majority Voting Mechanism:** Ensures high-quality pseudo-labels by aggregating multiple model predictions.
- **Parallel Training Support:** Optimized for training multiple YOLO models in parallel.
- **Dataset Splitting & Management:** Automatically handles labeled and unlabeled data during training.
- **Configurable Parameters:** Supports tuning of threshold values, confidence scores, and training settings.
- **Evaluation & Metrics:** Provides tools for assessing auto-annotated labels and trained models.
